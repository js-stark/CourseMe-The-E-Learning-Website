  <span> This Repository contains all the code executions for this website which has both student Login and Admin Login. In future I'll hook in more features with advanced Artificial Intelligence Implementations in my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jayasoruban1112/">Instagram</a> **stories**, which I'll also post here.
