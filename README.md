  <h1>50 Awesome Leetcode In Python + Javascript</h1>
  
 ---
  <span> This Repository contains all the notes and the code executions with detailed explanations for the codes and the theoretical implementations. In future I'll hook in the codes along with the explanations in my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jayasoruban1112/">Instagram</a> **stories**, which I'll also post here.
	  
LeetCode is essentially a huge repository of real interview questions asked by the most popular tech companies ( Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and more ).
The problem with LeetCode is also its advantage, IT'S HUGE, so huge in fact that interviewers from the most popular companies often directly ask questions they find on LeetCode, So it's hard to navigate through the huge amount of problems to find those that really matter, this is what this repo is for.

From Basic to Advanced Refresh your Python implementations of Leetcodes with theoretical addons. I have added the answers in the **collapsed sections** below the questions , simply click on them to expand. **Javascript Implementations are also hooked in!! Do check it**. It'll trigger you Cognizance and makes you a better learner. Good luck! ‚ù§Ô∏è </span>

| Feel free to fork and use it for your coding practices! üòÉ  I would _really_ appreciate a reference to this repo, These notes and code snippets make one a better learner I believe üí™üèº . Lets be a cohort of Awesome Coders and share the immortal knowledge foreverüåè Thank you and have fun!   |

<h1>Section 1</h1>
<h2> Big O Notation</h2>
<p>Algorithm analysis refers to the analysis of the complexity of different algorithms and finding the most efficient algorithm to solve the problem at hand. Big-O Notation is a statistical measure, used to describe the complexity of the algorithm.</p>
