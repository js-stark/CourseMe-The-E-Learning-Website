  <span> This Repository contains all the code executions for this website which has both student Login and Admin Login. In future I'll hook in more features with advanced Artificial Intelligence Implementations in my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jayasoruban1112/">Instagram</a> **stories**, which I'll also post here.
	  
ELearning, or electronic learning, is the delivery of learning and training through digital resources.

#### How to Use??

###### --> First Download the zip file and Extract the files init.
###### --> Install xampp or wamp servers for testing in local servers
###### --> Copy the code files into the htdocs folder in your xampp server
###### --> import the database files into your mysql server from localhost/phpmyadmin
###### --> Once files are extracted open the project in any editor such as VScode, atom etc.
###### --> Make sure that all the required file are installed.
###### --> Run the index.py file by specifying port address as localhost/file_name
###### --> Now you could see the Magic of the website displaying in the web
###### --> If you further wish to deploy it in the wideweb you can use cpanel containers to compile and publish in www.
